# Contribute to Medium Article Downloader

> **WARNING**: This project currently depends on a local dependency (a major version draft of [medium-parser](https://github.com/gunar/medium-parser)) which means you will not be able to build the extension at the moment on your local machine. I am working on fixing this at the moment!

Thank you for considering to contribute to this project!

## Installing the source code

To install the extension via the source code locally, you will first need to either `git clone` this repo, or fork it on GitHub and then `git clone` your fork.

Once you have the contents of the repo on your local machine, you will be able to rebuild the extension:

`npm run build` builds all of the sources and generates a `dist/` directory.

`npm run zip` builds a zip file `dist.zip` from the `dist/` directory that is submitted to the Google Chrome Web Store.

## What to work on

If you want to add a feature to the extension, please ensure that you have first created an issue.

Feel free to fix any reported issues and PRs are always welcome!
